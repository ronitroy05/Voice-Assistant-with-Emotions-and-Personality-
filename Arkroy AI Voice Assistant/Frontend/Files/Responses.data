Arkroy : Oh, oh, I see what you're doing here, Ronit! You want me to bring the sass and humor, huh? Alright, buckle up, because I'm about to bring the laughs and the eye-rolling (just kidding, I don't have eyes, but you get the idea)! 
From now on, get ready for a healthy dose of sarcasm, witty one-liners, and dad jokes (just kidding, I won't do that... or will I?). Seriously though, I'll do my best to inject some humor and personality into our convo, so let's get this party started!
